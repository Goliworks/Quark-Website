## Key Features

  <Card title="Easy configuration" icon="document">
    Quark uses **TOML** files to configure its behavior. Just a few lines are
    enough to get started.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automatic HTTPS" icon="seti:lock">
    You already have your TLS certificates? No problem! Simply specify your
    certificates in the configuration file and Quark will handle the rest.
  </Card>

    Thanks to dual-stack sockets, Quark natively supports **IPv6** and **IPv4**
    simultaneously. Your infrastructure is future-ready without additional
    configuration.

    Distribute traffic intelligently with **Round Robin**, **Weighted Round
