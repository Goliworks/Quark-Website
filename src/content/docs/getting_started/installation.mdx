You can install Quark by downloading the latest release or building it from source.

## Get the latest release

Download the latest release from Github [just here](https://github.com/Goliworks/Quark/releases).

Extract the contents of the downloaded archive and execute the installation script located in the extracted directory.

```bash
./install.sh
```

## Build from source

If you prefer to build Quark from its source code, follow these steps :

  You need at least **Rust 1.85** installed on your machine to build Quark.

First, clone the Quark GitHub repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Goliworks/Quark.git
cd Quark
```

### With the build tool

Use the provided build script located in the tools directory to compile Quark.

```bash
./tools/build.sh
```

It will build Quark and generate a `.tar.gz` file in a `./dist` directory.

Then, you can extract the archive and run :

```bash
./install.sh
```

### With Cargo

If you prefer to build Quark manually, you can use cargo instead of the build script.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

It will build generate a binary in a `./target/release` directory.

Then, you can execute directly the binary.

```bash
./target/release/quark --config /path/to/your/config_file.toml --logs /path/to/logs/directory
```

## After installation

Quark will run immediately on the port `:80` after installation.

You can can check it with:

```bash
systemctl status quark
```

## Uninstall Quark

To uninstall Quark, go in the extracted archive and run the uninstall script.

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```
